This repository holds my personal Jekyll blog, for hosting on GitHub pages.

This blog makes use of the Centrarium theme by Ben Centra, and includes a number of my own modifications to the
theme, including;
  * Adding Reddit as a social share option
  * Adding previous/next post links
  * Adding comment counts to the blog index
  * Adding a lightbox include
  * Adding a quote include
  * Updated Disqus functionality to work across multiple domains
  * Disabling of google analytics when not in production
